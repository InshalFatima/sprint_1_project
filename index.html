    <p> Abdul Sattar Edhi was born in February 28, 1928. He was a Pakistani humanitarian, philanthropist and ascetic who
        founded the Edhi Foundation, which runs the world's largest volunteer ambulance network, along with various
        homeless shelters, animal shelters, rehabilitation centres, and orphanages across Pakistan. Following his
        death, his
        son Faisal Edhi took over as head of the Edhi Foundation.</p>

    <p>
        Edhi's charitable activities expanded greatly in 1957 when an Asian flu epidemic (originating in China) swept
        through Pakistan and the rest of the world. Donations allowed him to buy his first ambulance the same year. He
        later expanded his charity network with the help of his wife Bilquis Edhi.

        Over his lifetime, the Edhi Foundation expanded, backed entirely by private donations, which included
        establishing a network of 1,800 ambulances. By the time of his death, Edhi was registered as a parent or
        guardian of nearly 20,000 adopted children of whom he was an active caretaker.[7] He is known amongst Pakistanis
        as the "Angel of Mercy" and is considered to be Pakistan's most respected and legendary figure.[3][13] In 2013,
        The Huffington Post claimed that he might be "the world's greatest living humanitarian"
